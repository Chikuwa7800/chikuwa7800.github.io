<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This site explains a person named Chikuwa, who has been brainwashed by Minecraft commands.</p>
<p>While I’ll introduce some other people as well, this site is primarily dedicated to describing the admin.</p>

<h1>About the Admin</h1>
<p><b>A madman who frequently typos his own name as "Chikwua."</b></p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<blockquote><p>Even if you ask me that... I'm just minced cod paste... I can only talk about the stories from when I was still alive, you know?</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s useless to try and escape with such nonsense.</p>
<p>Chikuwa originally went by the name <u><b>[Deleted by my own discretion after writing. You can find it in the oldest video on the YouTube channel]</b></u>.</p>
<p>Even back then, he was posting command videos, creating things like chairs made with Command Block 2 and throwable scythes.</p>
<p>However, he didn't like the name, so he changed it to "NullNull."</p>
<p>But that name led to the creation of a mountain of "cringe memories" (Kurorekishi). Just 8 months after opening the channel, he migrated to a different channel under the name "Leaves."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the growth of the migrated channel was painfully slow, so he returned to the "NullNull" channel as his main base of operations.</p>
<p>It was at that time he changed his channel name to "Chikuwa," which brings us to the present.</p>
<p><s>By the way, it’s a little secret that when he moved back and re-uploaded some videos from the Leaves channel to the Chikuwa channel, his subscriber count and views suddenly skyrocketed.</s></p>
<p>He used to post several survival series videos, but they weren't well-received. After realizing (<s>much later</s>) that he isn't suited for those types of videos and creates too much cringe content, he is currently sticking to his roots and restraining himself.</p>

<h2>Abilities</h2>
<blockquote><p>Abilities?! I don't know anything about that! Seriously!</p></blockquote>
<p>There's no way we're letting him get away with that.</p>
<p>The most noteworthy points are, naturally, his Minecraft knowledge and skills.</p>
<p>With about 10 years of Minecraft experience (as of 2026), he can pull off most things... although he’s only practiced glitches like half-shifting a little, so he can't do them at all. If anything, his strengths are Water Bucket MLG and archery. <s>Bedrock Edition? I don't know that.</s></p>
<p>Specifically with commands, while there are plenty of people better than him, he is certainly more capable than your average player.</p>
<p>When it comes to Data Packs, his skill level is even higher. <s>Bedrock Edition? Never heard of it.</s></p>
<p>Additionally, he has a natural constitution for attracting "weird people."</p>
<p>On the negative side, he has a poor memory.</p>
<p>That said, it’s not that he forgets everything; it’s more that he remembers some specific things while forgetting almost everything else.</p>
<p>Perhaps... no, let's stop there before it gets scary.</p>
<p>Other traits include poor articulation and a tendency to make decisions based on the heat of the moment.</p>
<h1>Creations</h1><p>The largest-scale project created so far is <a href="https://chikuwa7800.hatenablog.com/entry/main">Trip and Magic</a>(as of 2026).</p>
<figure class="figure-image figure-image-fotolife" title="↑ Title image. The items shown are some of the items added by this data pack."><img src="/assets/img/figure/001.png" class="img-figure"><figcaption>↑ Title image. The items shown are some of the items added by this data pack.</figcaption></figure>
<p>He was also making a data pack called "Weapons & Creatures," but it was scrapped.</p>
<blockquote><p>Recently, I've been making something called "Weapons and Creatures." It's still a work in progress—or rather, I haven't even finished the first boss yet—so the release might be a while off.</p>
    <cite><a href="https://kazunekoo.hatenablog.com/entry/2023/05/24/190117">Homepage - leefen's blog</a></cite></blockquote><p>...See? I told you.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>For some reason, my own ego started leaking out towards the end, but let's wrap up the introduction for now.</p>
<p>And so, the story of Chikuwa, entwined with cringeworthy memories, has only just begun...</p>
